A Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal program with a graphical user interface (GUI) to find the optimal path.

In this program, you first define "walls" that the algorithm will avoid, and then set the "starting" and "destination" points.

As the algorithm runs, you will visually observe how it explores each neighboring node. Once traversal is complete, the program will display the best possible path.
